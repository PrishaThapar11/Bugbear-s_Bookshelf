            <h1>About Me &#128059;</h1>

            <p> Hey there, this is Bugbear. Welcome to my humble little corner of the internet—Bugbear's Bookshelf.<br><br>
                You might be wondering, why “Bugbear”?  it's a name that stuck with me after listening to Bugbear by Chloe Moriondo. 
                It goes like this: <br>
                "I feel so brain dead next to you<br>
                It's not like you intended to<br>
                Hurt me or make me feel that way<br>
                And I'm not tryin' to complain<br>
                But it just sucks to try and explain<br> 
                Why I feel like this everyday" <br>
                The song's chill, almost mocking tone makes light of things that are actually kind of serious—feeling out of place, 
                a little lost, a little slower to pick up on things that seem effortless to others. And yes, that hit a little too close to home.
                <br>
                Not because I think I'm stupid—I know I'm not. But sometimes, my words come out wrong, or I struggle with the most basic everyday 
                things like directions, organizing my stuff, or making quick decisions. I like thinking things through, picking apart details, 
                and observing people more than my surroundings. It's funny how that works.<br>
                I'm not one to brag, but I'm what you call "academically gifted", I'm adept at solving problems, and my head is full of all sorts 
                of random knowledge, but I never feel the need to prove it. Maybe that's why I'm sometimes mistaken for being naive, quiet, or just “there.” 
                This is why her song stuck with me like superglue. But that's okay. This blog is my way of creating a space that's mine—a place where I can talk about
                books, thoughts, tech, and everything in between.<br><br>
                And who knows? Maybe one day, I'll prove just how smart I really am.<br><br>
                hugs and kisses, <br>
                Bugbear&hearts;</p>
