            <h1>Code, Coffee, and the Constant Quest for Semicolons</h1>
            <p class="metadata">January 15, 2025 | By Prisha Thapar | Type: Tech</p>

            <p> I'm always intrigued by how learning to code feels like two things at once - on a good day it feels like stepping into a 
                new world, where every line of code is an adventure and a chance to create something of value. On an even better day (initially), 
                it's like trying to put together a puzzle with half the pieces missing- and no picture on the box. I've had more than my
                fair share of “why won't this work?” moments. I've stared at my screen, convinced that my code is cursed, only to realize I missed 
                a semicolon. I've spent hours debugging, only to find that the issue was the tiniest, most ridiculous mistake. but each time I figure 
                out the problem I learn something new. I'm not just writing code, I'm learning to problem-solve, think critically, work hard
                and get hands-on. This journey is as rewarding as it is challenging.<br> I'm still new to coding, but I've never felt more at home. It feels
                 like this was made for me. But we must talk about the elephant in the room. Tech is competitive. Like, brutally competitive. 
                 And no matter how much I love it, I can't help but feel those pangs of jealousy, those creeping thoughts of “why am I not good enough?” 
                 The comparison trap is so easy to fall into. And trust me, as the high-achieving eldest daughter, I get competitive about everything. 
                 For me, everything is a challenge. And I know that the right thing to say here is that "I've started to realize that this mindset might not
                  take me anywhere, especially not where I want to go".  Because there will always be a better Asian. That's just life. So I'm slowly learning 
                  how to stop myself from measuring my progress against others. I want to learn because I want to, because I love it, because I have this 
                  never-ending curiosity about how things work. I want to get better—not to be better than someone else, but to be better than who I was yesterday.
                I hope I can keep learning with that mindset. With a thirst for knowledge, for skills, for the sheer joy of figuring things out—rather than just trying 
                to outdo someone else. Because in the end, the only real competition I should be in is with myself. </p>
