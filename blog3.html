            <h1>The Donkey, the Horse, and the Blood-Soaked Handkerchief</h1>
            <p class="metadata">Feb 1, 2025 | By Prisha Thapar | Type: Personal Reflection</p>

            <p> I look down at my blood-soaked handkerchief, clutching it tightly like it's the only thing keeping me from falling apart. My nose bleeds,
                 my head pounds, and my limbs feel like they've been wrung dry. Even the slightest sight of blood makes me feel faint. I long for my parents.<br><br>
                I have always been someone who works really damn hard. I bend my back backwards, not just to get things done, but to make sure they're one of—if 
                not the—best. Every time. And every time, I end up feeling like the human personification of a donkey. That's what it is. I must face it. 
                Endless hours of sheer labor, pushing, pulling, dragging my way through tasks while others glide past with half the effort. Smart work gets 
                people better results, and yet here I am—stubborn, exhausted, barely holding it together. The past few months have been a battle between keeping
                 the donkey alive and trying to raise a horse. I know it's good to work hard, but when the price is a trip to the ER with a 104-degree fever, 
                 is it really worth it?<br>
                I've always had this reckless belief that my body is young, that it can handle a few sleepless nights, a few skipped meals, a few back-to-back 
                days of overworking myself into the ground. My friends do it too and they seem to be perfectly fine, I should be fine too right? Wrong. 
                My sugar levels free-fall like nobody's business. My eyes burn like hell. And by the end of the week, I'm wrecked. Fever-ridden, weaker than ever, 
                looking even shorter than usual (if that's even possible). The antibiotics make my nose bleed, my body feels like an empty husk, and the worst part? 
                I still feel like I'm falling behind.<br>
                Because while I'm lying in bed, trying to keep myself from passing out, all the good opportunities are passing me by. Everyone else is grabbing them, 
                rushing forward, climbing higher while I lie on my bed helplessly, stuck in this endless cycle of burnout and recovery. <br>
                
                I don't know how to fix it yet. I don't know how to stop being the donkey and start being the horse. But I do know one thing—if I keep going like this, 
                there won't be a horse to raise. There won't even be a donkey left to push forward.<br>
                
                Maybe working hard isn't about breaking myself apart every time. Maybe it's about learning when to stop, when to rest, and when to let go. I just hope 
                I figure it out before I hit the ground again.</p>
