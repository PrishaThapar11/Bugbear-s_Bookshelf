            <p class="blog-excerpt">I finish reading the book. I sit on my bed motionless
                and realize this isn't a happy book. I didn't get my happy ending.
                It was never a happy book to begin with. I knew this when I started
                reading it. Yet I clung on to the last bit of hope there was.
                I'm not allowed to feel disappointed. It was exactly what I
                should have expected. </p>

            <p class="blog-excerpt"> I'm always intrigued by how learning to code feels like two things at once - on
                a good day it feels like stepping into a new world, where every line of code is an adventure and a
                chance to create something of value. On an even better day (initially), it's like trying to put
                together a puzzle with half the pieces missing- and no picture on the box. I've had more than my
                fair share of “why won't this work?” moments, I've stared at my screen, convinced that my code is cursed,
                 only to realize I missed a semicolon. I've spent hours debugging, only to find that the issue was the 
                 tiniest, most ridiculous mistake. but each time I figure out the problem I learn something new. I'm not 
                 just writing code, I'm learning to problem-solve, think critically, work hard and get hands-on. This journey 
                 is as rewarding as it is challenging. .</p>

                <p class="blog-excerpt">I look down at my blood-soaked handkerchief, clutching it tightly like it's the only
                     thing keeping me from falling apart. My nose bleeds, my head pounds, and my limbs feel like they've been 
                     wrung dry. Even the slightest sight of blood makes me feel faint. I long for my parents. </p>
