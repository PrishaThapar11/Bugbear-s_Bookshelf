            <h1>The Book That Compelled Me To Start This Blog</h1>
            <p class="metadata">January 10, 2025 | By Prisha Thapar | Type: Book Review</p>

            <p> I finish reading the book. I sit on my bed motionless and realize this isn't a happy book.
                I didn't get my happy ending. It was never a happy book to begin with. I knew this when
                i started reading it. Yet I clung on to the last bit of hope there was. I'm not allowed to
                feel disappointed. It was exactly what one would have expected. <br>
                I'm afraid I'm late to the club...but I finally got the chance to read one of the most acclaimed novel
                of
                Nobel Prize winner Kazuo Ishiguro.
                The only "complaint" you'll ever hear from me about this book is its genre being labeled as science
                fiction (???). Technically, sure, it fits. But I think the tag is misleading. The so-called “science
                fiction” aspect—cloning, organ donation—is barely explored in the way you'd expect. It lingers in
                the background, subtly present, yet never the focus. This was also why I was skeptical about picking
                it up—I haven't exactly had the best experience with sci-fi books.
                But Never Let Me Go? This book isn't about science. It's about humanity. <br>
                Although I might have enjoyed the book even more if the whole organ donation/human
                cloning aspect was explored in an explicitly
                morbid fashion rather than Ishiguro's signature quiet, restrained storytelling. (I understand that
                this defeats the entire purpose)<br>
                What sets this book apart is not the plot but it's execution. The way Kazuo Ishiguro paints a
                heartbreakingly beautiful picture of a group of boarding school students trapped in a losing fight
                between
                nature and nurture.<br>
                <br>
                "None of you will go to America, none of you
                will be film stars. And none of you will be
                working in supermarkets as I heard some of
                you planning the other day. Your lives are
                set out for you".<br>
                <br>
                I have never read a book so absurdly morbid and unhinged, yet so tranquil and thought provoking.
                It forces you to sit with your thoughts. To question. <br>

                I was FLOORED by the Ishiguro's ability to grasp the point of view of the narrator so gracefully.
                He makes you believe that Kathy H is a real person and these are her actual experiences. As much as
                I tried to despise some of the characters I just couldn't because of how everyone's actions seemed
                justified by the situations they were in.No one was truly evil or good. Just… human.
                <br>
                But what does it even mean to be human?
                <br>
                This book raises some of the most harrowing questions I've ever encountered in a dystopian novel.
                <br>
                What is the defining feature of humanity? And who gets to decide?<br>
                Are you complete even if you were created for someone else's convenience?<br>
                Are you complete even if your entire existence was designed to serve another's?<br>
                When you fulfill the purpose forced upon you, does your life belong to you—or to the world that took
                everything from you?<br>

                Never Let Me Go is one of the few novels that genuinely lives up to its hype.<br>

                A few details in the novel hurt my heart like a thousand stab wounds. How every
                student at Hailsham longs to be a favorite of a Guardian, to feel special beyond
                the tiny drawer where they keep their secondhand belongings and sketches.
                Or Kathy's childhood belief that Norfolk is "a lost corner of England" where
                everything missing in life can be found again. A small, innocent fantasy—one
                that becomes devastating when you realize how much she's lost.<br>


                This book is scary. Not horror book scary. But reality- scary. Scary in the way
                that we might one day reach a point where people and children—are used like objects.
                And worse, in the way they might accept it.
                There is no rebellion. No dramatic fight against the system. Just quiet compliance.
                Not because the characters are stupid, but because they've been raised to believe this
                is all there is.<br><br>
                This isn't a happy book.<br>
                But it's one I'll never forget.</p>
